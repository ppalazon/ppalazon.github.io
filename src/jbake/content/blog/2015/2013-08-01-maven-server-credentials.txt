List of commands

mvn --encrypt-master-password <password>
mvn --encrypt-password <password>

Copy and paste:

Maven 2.1.0+ now supports server password encryption. The main use case, addressed by this solution is:

    multiple users share the same build machine (server, CI box)
    some users have the privilege to deploy Maven artifacts to repositories, some don't.
        this applies to any server operations, requiring authorization, not only deployment
    settings.xml is shared between users

The implemented solution adds the following capabilities:

    authorized users have an additional settings-security.xml file in their ~/.m2 folder
        this file either contains encrypted master password, used to encrypt other passwords
        or it can contain a relocation - reference to another file, possibly on removable storage
        this password is created first via CLI for now
    server entries in the settings.xml have passwords and/or keystore passphrases encrypted
        for now - this is done via CLI after master password has been created and stored in appropriate location
