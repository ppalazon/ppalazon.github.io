Suppose than native enconding is utf-8

View file encoding with file

     file -bi filename.txt

Change file enconding
     iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t utf-8 messages_fr.properties > messages_fr_utf-8.properties

Escape utf-8 characters with java application native2ascii
    native2ascii message_fr_utf8.properties messages_fr_ascii.properties

Rewrite original messages_fr.properties to ascii
